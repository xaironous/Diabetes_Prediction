# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project is my **first Machine Learning / Data Science project**, where I built a model to predict diabetes based on diagnostic measures. The dataset used was obtained from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/houcembenmansour/predict-diabetes-based-on-diagnostic-measures)**.

## 📌 Project Overview  
- ✅ **Goal**: Predict whether a patient has diabetes based on health indicators.  
- 📊 **Dataset**: Contains diagnostic measures such as **glucose level, BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.**  
- 🛠️ **Machine Learning Model Used**:  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- 📈 **Model Evaluation**:  
  - Used **accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix** to assess model performance.  
  - Applied **cross-validation** to ensure model stability.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Preprocessing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning Model)
